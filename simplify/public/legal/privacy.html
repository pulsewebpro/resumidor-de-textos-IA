    <h1>Simplify · Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Simplify (“we”, “us”) handles personal data when you use the Service.</p>

    <h2>1. Data controller</h2>
    <p>PULSE WEB PRO is responsible for the Service. Contact <a href="mailto:privacy@simplify.ai">privacy@simplify.ai</a> for privacy questions.</p>

    <h2>2. Data we process</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Usage identifiers:</strong> we generate an anonymous user ID stored locally in your browser to keep track of available credits.</li>
      <li><strong>Input text:</strong> prompts are sent to the AI model transiently to generate the requested output. We do not persist user text.</li>
      <li><strong>Payment data:</strong> handled exclusively by Stripe. We receive payment status, plan type and metadata but never card numbers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Cookies and storage</h2>
    <p>We use localStorage for the anonymous wallet token and language preferences. No marketing cookies are set.</p>

    <h2>4. Legal basis</h2>
    <p>Processing is based on performance of a contract (providing the Service) and legitimate interests (security and fraud prevention).</p>

    <h2>5. Data retention</h2>
    <p>Wallet tokens expire automatically according to the plan duration. AI prompts are not retained after the response is delivered. Payment records are kept according to accounting obligations.</p>

    <h2>6. Data sharing</h2>
    <p>We share limited data with trusted processors: Stripe (payments) and OpenAI (AI inference). Each processor acts under contract and cannot use your data for their own purposes.</p>

    <h2>7. International transfers</h2>
    <p>Processors may operate outside your jurisdiction. Appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses are in place when required.</p>

    <h2>8. Your rights</h2>
    <p>You may request access, correction, deletion or restriction of your personal data. Contact us to exercise these rights.</p>

    <h2>9. Updates</h2>
    <p>We may update this Policy to reflect changes in the Service or regulation. We will notify users through the product interface when significant changes occur.</p>
